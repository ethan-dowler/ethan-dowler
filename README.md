# Bringing Hope to Students Across America

As part of the [Ramsey Education](https://www.ramseyeducation.com/) development team (a department of [Ramsey Solutions](https://ramseysolutions.com/)), I work with [a small team of amazing people](https://www.ramseyinhouse.com/) to develop a digital platform that delivers our life-changing personal finance and entrepreneurship curriculum to millions of students across the US.

We love [Ruby on Rails](https://rubyonrails.org/), [React JS](https://reactjs.org/), and [Magnolia CMS](https://www.magnolia-cms.com/) (my personal favorite of the three is [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/)! ❤️).

We do work that matters because we do our work ["as unto the Lord"](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Colossians%203%3A23-24&version=ESV).

If you need help on a Ruby project that brings hope to others, consider tagging me on Github.

On a personal note, I love screamo music, board games, and video games, so if you have any recommendations, send them my way.

Best of luck to you on your programming journey!
