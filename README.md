# Bringing Hope to Immigrants, Refugees, and Asylees

## Professional

As a member of IntelliBridge, I serve as a contractor to the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services.

## Personal

I love [Ruby on Rails](https://rubyonrails.org/), and [React](https://reactjs.org/) is pretty cool too.

I do work that matters because I do my work ["as unto the Lord"](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Colossians%203%3A23-24&version=ESV).

I love screamo music, board games, and video games, so if you have any recommendations, send them my way.

## Reach Out

If you need help on a Ruby project that brings hope to others, consider tagging me on Github.

Best of luck to you on your programming journey!
